"""
This file contains the logic needed to compile down an operation and produce
an execution order that is compatible with the order found in the command
compiler.

This file contains two methods a parse and a compile method for operations.
The parse method returns the metadata needed by the command compiler to know
what values the operation will use.

The second one is the compile method which returns the execution order for
the compile operation. It is important to know that all operation should have
an `is_compilable` flag set to true if they are compilable. Some operations
such as the `add` operation are not compilable as their transition method
contains execution logic that will not be captured by the compiled command.
