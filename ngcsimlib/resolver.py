TODO: rewrite to have this be the less favorable option

The resolver is an important part of the compiling of components and commands
in the ngcsimlib compilers.

At its core the resolver links a pure (static) method with a class method
that knows how to process the output values of the pure method and set the
correct compartment's values from it.

While a resolver can take in many arguments generally this is not needed as
it will automatically map all the values it needs from argument lines. When
writing the resolvers and the pure functions being passed into them the names
of the arguments are very important, this extends to the name of the method
the resolver is wrapping as that is the name the resolver is saved under.
When the compiler is searching for how to compile the compile key for a given
component it searches through all the resolvers on the class for any wrapping
a method with the same name as the compile key. On top of serving as the
compile key the wrapped function provides the knowledge of where output
values of the compiled function should go and should not contain any runtime
logic as this wrapped method will not be called when the command is compiled.

The parsing of output_compartments, args, parameters, and compartments is
done during compiling the resolvers, but it will be explained here.

To parse the output_compartments the resolver looks at the names and order of
the arguments in the method it is wrapping. When it is compiled these names
are the names of the compartments the compiled method will try to locate to
place the resultant values in. It is important to note that the number of
output values of the pure method and the number of input values should match
for automatic mapping.

To parse the args, parameters, and compartments the argument names of the
pure method are considered. First the compiler will check to see if the name
exists as an attribute on the object. If it does not exist the compiler
assume that this value is an argument being passed in by the user. In the
event that it is present on the object it checks to see if it is an instance
of a compartment. In the event that it is it will add it to the compartments
list otherwise it will add it to the parameter list.

    The decorator used to tell the ngcsimlib compiler how to compile methods

    Args:
        pure_fn: the pure function where the run time logic is located

        output_compartments: a list of output compartment names (default: None)

        args: a list of arguments being passed into the pure function
