    Components are a foundational part of ngclearn and its component/command
    structure. In ngclearn, all stateful parts of a model take the form of
    components. The internal storage of the state within a component takes
    one of two forms, either as a compartment or as a member variable. The
    member variables are values such as hyperparameters and weights/synaptic
    efficacies, where the transfer of their individual state from component
    to component is not needed. Compartments, on the other hand, are where
    the state information, both from and for other components, are stored. As
    the components are the stateful pieces of the model, they also contain
    the methods and logic behind advancing their internal state (values)
    forward in time.

        undefined behavior present if multiple components in a model have the
        same name.
